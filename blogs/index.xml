We have to develop a backup software under the responsibility of the CIO. This backup software is part of the &amp;ldquo;EasySave&amp;rdquo; project, so it is our responsibility to manage this project.
Problematic How to make multiple secure backups?
Achievements First of all, we had to create a console application offering several types of backups. Indeed, we had the choice between full backups (all files), and partial backups (only different files).</description></item><item><title>Web development</title><link>https://rakk0o.aphorya.fr/blogs/webdev/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2022 12:15:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://rakk0o.aphorya.fr/blogs/webdev/</guid><description>Subject Problematic Achievements Acquired skills</description></item><item><title>Signal</title><link>https://rakk0o.aphorya.fr/blogs/signal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 12:15:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://rakk0o.aphorya.fr/blogs/signal/</guid><description>Subject Agent K17 has infiltrated the secret base of major web hackers and managed to steal information from them but unfortunately is stuck in a conference room. He must transmit the information and send the emergency code &amp;ldquo;ESCAPE K17&amp;rdquo; without being detected.
Problematic How to pass a message that must be undetectable through a microphone used by a a third party?
Achievements We started by studying the sound in a general way, and deduced that all the frequencies were not audible by the Man, and that these frequencies leave a trace called spectrum which can be obtained from a sound signal.</description></item><item><title>Data Base</title><link>https://rakk0o.aphorya.fr/blogs/database/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 12:15:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://rakk0o.aphorya.fr/blogs/database/</guid><description>Subject Hephaestus makes legendary weapons and equipment, and with the help of Hermes, his business is flourishing. Hermes wanted to establish himself in Egypt and managed to take over the administration and management of Hephaestus&amp;rsquo; sales. He then wishes to exploit the data collected by Hephaestus during the last centuries in order to increase the sales.
Problematic How can Hermès increase sales?
Achievements We started by creating an algebraic model. Indeed we had to go from a database realized on Excel, to a clean database with MySQL.</description></item><item><title>Electronics</title><link>https://rakk0o.aphorya.fr/blogs/electronics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2019 12:15:16 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://rakk0o.aphorya.fr/blogs/electronics/</guid><description>Subject The MI7 spy agency asked us to work on a new generation safe with increased authentication mechanisms. Thus, there would be several electronic cards with their own number. These cards could then activate the authentication system, which is composed of several authentication levels.
Problematic How to make a card able to secure authentication?
Achievements We started by making a logigram corresponding to the different cards linked to a certain authentication level.</description></item></channel></rss>
