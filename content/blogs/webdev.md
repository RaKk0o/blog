## Subject

The objective of this project was to create a website gathering the different internship offers, and displaying the companies looking for or having an intern. It was possible to search for an offer, to modify, to add and to delete it. These were classified by skills in order to obtain a relevant search result.

## Problem

How can we create an intuitive site that will allow students to search for internships?

## Achievements

We started by making mock-ups to orient our graphical interface.

Then we studied the data we would need to build our future database.
Finally we realized the web site.
The website was composed of an authentication interface, as well as an administrator, student, delegate, and internship pilot interface.
The web application took into account different user profiles that each had rights and access according to their profile.
The expected functionalities were role management, company management, internship offer management and application management. The functionalities were accessible according to the user profile, and the admin could consult all the functionalities.

## Acquired skills

During this project, I was able to learn how to use HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and frameworks such as bootstrap and jQuery.
