## Subject

Our team has just joined the software publisher ProSoft. We have to develop a backup software under the responsibility of the CIO. This backup software is part of the "EasySave" project, so it is our responsibility to manage this project.

## Problem

How to make multiple secure backups?

## Achievements

First of all, we had to create a console application offering several types of backups. Indeed, we had the choice between full backups (all files), and partial backups (only different files).
The menu was displayed with several choices:
- Change language
- Choice of the backup
- Display of the logs
- Status display

It was then possible to change the language, to choose a type of backup, to display the logs of completed backups, and to display the status of ongoing and completed backups.

Then we took our application and added views to it with the same basic functionality. However, we also added data encryption.

## Acquired skills

During this project, we were able to learn GitLab, diagram modeling, and the C# language.
