## Subject

The mayor of Funkytown (a fictional city) wants to support a digital policy for the city's businesses. This support comes at the right time for the ESN eXia, which has just set up in the city. Many contracts have been won thanks to this support policy.

## Problem

How to deploy configurations for all businesses in the city?

## Achievements

During this project we worked on a packet tracer model regrouping several companies or premises. On this model we had to realize :
- Private addressing of all the companies
- Public addressing of all the companies
- Public addressing on the interconnection part of the different sites (ISP)
- Public addressing of the elements in Datacenter
- IPV6 tunnel between eXia and Datacenter

Besides the technical part, we were asked to organize ourselves as much as possible using tools such as a Gantt chart for example.

## Acquired skills

This project allowed me to acquire team and project management skills, but also CISCO technical skills that allowed me to pass my CCNA1.
