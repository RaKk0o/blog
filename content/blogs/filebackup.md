## Subject

My mom asked me for an app where she could store her sheet music and find it easily. So I proposed her to make it in order to train myself. The project is still in progress.

## Problem

How to save files in a secure way while making them accessible?

## Achievements

For the moment, the back-end part of the application (in python) has started, but the front-end has not yet started.

I also plan to train on other things:
I want to deploy a kubernetes cluster that will then allow me to run an ansible configuration automatically. 
For that, I will stay in intranet, and deploy the whole thing on a raspeberry pi equipped with an extra hard drive, on which the storage will be done. Indeed, the SD card of the raspberry being known to be fragile, I prefer to ensure the blow with an external hard disk.

## Acquired skills

At the end of the project, I will in theory be able to build an entire web application in python, as well as deploy a kubernetes cluster and use ansible to automate the configuration. Indeed, I have already been able to do kubernetes and ansible, so this should not be a problem for me.
