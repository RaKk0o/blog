## Subject

Aphorya is a social network project currently under development. Once completed, it will allow players to have a place where they can meet and plan their games. The goal is to bring players together and allow them to easily find gaming groups.

## Problem

How do you develop a social network that brings people together?

## Achievements

Currently, the projects is in its infancy, for the moment we have not achieved much. However, we have already realized the specifications, which are as follows:

    - Validated streamers

We also have some constraints:

    - PC application
- To be implemented later :
    - Phone application

Some mock-ups are also made, like the connection page for example:

![Connect](/img/projects/aphorya/connect.png)

We have also already implemented account creation and login, especially through the Discord API.

## Acquired skills

Since the project is not finished, I have not yet acquired everything. However, at the end, I will have learned how to plan an entire project, as well as how to use python as part of the back-end of the application.
